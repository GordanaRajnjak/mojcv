<p class="paragraf" id="html">Since HTML is probably the first thing each Front End developer starts with, 
    I have a lot of experience with it, 
    making many HTML documents in which I have got better 
    and better and found great uses in HTML5 elements for mobile devices.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="css">CSS is one of those things that I love the most about my job. 
    It's a real pleasure for me to turn those rough but functional HTML pages 
    into beautiful websites with awesome layouts. 
    My love for CSS has motivated me to explore numerous layouts, 
    with an emphasize on the Flexbox and Grid system.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="sass">When I say CSS, I mean SASS. 
    I never write my CSS without SASS and each workday for me starts with "compass watch" :)</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="bootstrap">Making websites using Bootstrap is probably one of the easiest things 
    for a Front End developer. It shortens the process and makes things easy for all of us, 
    but I equally enjoy upgrading my Bootstrap websites with custom parts and details.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="javascript">I wanted to put my websites in motion so I also started learning Javascript. 
    Now my websites have various interactive elements to make the experince more pleasurable, 
    thus giving the users an additional reason to stay longer on them.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="jquery">I've at first entered the world of animations using JQuery, 
    which was for me like a real Wonderland. 
    I always have a ton of ideas how to animate various elements and make the whole website 
    much more fun. Also, JQuery has been of great help in making the process of 
    coding with Javascript quicker and my code more concise.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="ajax">While working on the communication with the server 
    I've learned how to use AJAX and JSON. REST API is the thing that 
    I've been working with the most lately. Thanks to this, 
    I've been also learning how to work and collaborate with the Back End programmer, 
    which is a very interesting experience for me.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="drupal">Drupal was the first CMS framework that I have started working with as a 
    Front End developer. During my internship at Fermicoding, on my supervisor's recommendation, 
    I've started learning Drupal 8 to keep up the pace with the current Drupal trends. 
    With a lot of effort and very little documentation and modules for this, 
    I've managed to make my first website in it. Thanks to this internship I've learned 
    the principles of using CMSs and are able to use them in making functioning websites.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="wordpress">I’m currently learning Wordpress and I’ve set it a 
    goal for myself to know how to use it proficiently. I find that it’s very useful 
    and I’m very eager to continue learning it thoroughly.</p>

<p class="paragraf" id="git">I’ve had the opportunity to use both Github and Gitlab. 
    They have generally shown to be very useful to me, not only in keeping track of different 
    versions of the project but also in collaboration with the Back End developer.</p>
